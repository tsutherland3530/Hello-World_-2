# Hello-World_-2

Hi this is my second Hello-World program I'm built for a school homework demo.  I am a junior coder who is always looking to expand my experience and knowledge.  Always curious and open minded to understand new and interesting concepts in the ever expanding technology industries. Learn something new and interesting about this process everytime I buld a new project on Git! 😁
